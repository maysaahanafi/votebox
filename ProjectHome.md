## Introduction ##

**VoteBox** is an electronic voting system designed by [computer security researchers](http://seclab.cs.rice.edu) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu). It is not an Internet-based voting platform; rather, it is software that is intended to be used on computer terminals in a supervised polling place.  VoteBox runs on standard Macs, Windows, and Linux computers.

The **design of VoteBox** is described in detail in several [research papers](http://votebox.cs.rice.edu/#pubs), particularly our [paper](http://www.usenix.org/events/sec08/tech/sandler.html) and [presentation](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dsandler/talks/votebox-sec08/votebox-sec08.pdf) from USENIX Security 2008.

The **project home page** is [votebox.cs.rice.edu](http://votebox.cs.rice.edu), where you can find contact information and a general project description. The [source code](http://code.google.com/p/votebox/source/checkout/#svn/trunk) for VoteBox is hosted here at [votebox.googlecode.com](http://code.google.com/p/votebox), along with instructions for [setting up an election](SimpleElection.md) and additional [wiki documentation](http://code.google.com/p/votebox/w/list).
