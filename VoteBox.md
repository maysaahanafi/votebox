# VoteBox Software Specification: User Interface Module #

The VoteBox User Interface Module, more commonly the "VoteBox booth", is what voters interact with during an election. It presents a DRE ("direct recording electronic") style graphical user interface allowing a voter to make selections and commit them at the end of her voting session.

The exact graphic appearance of VoteBox is entirely dictated by the BallotDefinitionFile; the following is an example of a page from a ballot generated by the current [ballot creator](PrepToolGuide.md):

## Usage ##

Using already built jar file
```
java -jar votebox.jar [serial number]
```
or
```
java -Djava.library.path=path/to/directory/with/libSDL_wrap/file -jar votebox.jar [serial number]
```
to make the SDL view available (note that SDL must still be selected in the appropriate configuration file).

See also SimpleElection, FullElection. Additional configuration options are outlined in [Configuration](Configuration.md).

Please refer to the [Doxygen documentation](http://votebox.cs.rice.edu/doxygen/) as a guide to the program's internals; see also the [Java source code](http://code.google.com/p/votebox/source/browse/#svn/trunk).
